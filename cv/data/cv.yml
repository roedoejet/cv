    description: ReadAlong-Studio is a Python package and web application for doing zero-shot forced text/audio alignment. In other words, given text and audio in a language for which you have no training data, you can create the alignment (time stamps) between the text and audio. You can export this either as SMIL (which can be used to visualize the alignment through the ReadAlong Web Component), as an EPUB for viewing on an e-reader or SRT/WebVTT subtitle formats.
